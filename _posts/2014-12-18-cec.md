##General
------

CEC aims to efficiently implement Cross Entropy Clustering Algorithm as R extension.

##Installation
-----------

You can install CEC as an R package, the easiest way for this is using devtools.

To install devtools you need

```R
> install.packages('devtools')
```

If you use Debian you can install some dependencies with

```bash
# apt-get install r-cran-rcpparmadillo r-cran-rcurl
```

Make sure you have boost if you are unix/mac user. It is packaged in most distributions.
For instance in ubuntu you can download it using

```bash
# apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

to install CEC

```R
devtools::install_github("gmum/gmum.r/tree/cec")
```

See **Known issues** if your installation fails.

##Usage
-----

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
library(devtools)
load_all('../')
dataset <- as.matrix(read.table("../inst/data_sets/cec/mouse_1_spherical/input.txt"))
```

that is the dataset we want to cluster

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(dataset)
```

run cec with default parameters

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
c <- CEC(k=3, x=dataset)
plot(c)
```

since initial clusterization is random it may be a good idea to run cec multiple times and choose the best result

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
c <- CEC(k=3, x=dataset, control.nstart=10)
plot(c)
```

better than before, however, we know that clusters are spherical; let's inform cec about that

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
c <- CEC(k=3, x=dataset, control.nstart=10, method.type='sphere')
plot(c)
```

you can learn details of clustering like this

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
centers(c)
cov(c)
```

you can predict cluster which a point would belong to

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
predictCluster(c, c(1,1))
```

or find out what are the probabilities of belonging to each cluster

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
predictClusters(c, c(1,1))
```

you can visualise size and shape of clusters

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(c, ellipses=TRUE)
```

try the same with random assignment

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
c <- CEC(k=3, x=dataset, control.nstart=10, method.type='sphere', method.init='random')
plot(c)
```

##Testing
-----
There are two sets of tests. You can run them seperately. One require Google C++ Test Framework, the other dectools.

To run tests in Google C++ Test Framework

```bash
$ cd gmum/test/cpp
$ export GTEST='path to google c++ test framework'
$ make
$ ./mouse_1_test #for instance
```

To run R tests type

```
$ cd gmum
$ R
> devtools::test(".")
```

---------
Feel free to contribute to the code. Contributions should be posted as pull requests.

You can get your own copy and compile it like this

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gmum/gmum.r
$ cd gmum
$ R
> library(devtools)
> load_all()
> #you can use CEC from now on
```
